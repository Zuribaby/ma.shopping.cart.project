Individual Capstone Project – Shopping Cart
The project will be split into the following steps:

Step 1: Set up the HTML structure

Create an HTML file (index.html) and set up the basic HTML structure with the necessary elements for the shopping cart.
Add a heading to display the name of the product being sold.
Include an input field for users to enter the desired quantity of the product.
Add a button to add the selected quantity to the shopping cart and add an “onclick” attribute to call a JavaScript function.
Create a div element to display the shopping cart’s contents and total cost.
Step 2: Style the page using CSS and Bootstrap

Create a CSS file (styles.css) and link it to the HTML file.
Add Bootstrap to the project by linking to the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files.
Style the page using CSS and Bootstrap components, such as containers, rows, and columns. Adjust the colors, fonts, and layout to create a visually appealing design.
Step 3: Add JavaScript functionality

Create a JavaScript file (scripts.js) and link it to the HTML file.
Write a function to handle adding items to the shopping cart. This function should:
Retrieve the entered quantity from the input field.
Update the shopping cart’s contents with the new quantity.
Calculate the total cost based on the quantity and the product’s price.
Write a function to handle removing items from the shopping cart. This function should:
Clear the shopping cart’s contents.
Reset the total cost to zero.
Write a function to update the displayed shopping cart contents and total cost in the HTML.
Step 4: Connect functions to HTML elements

In the HTML file, add the “onclick” attribute to the ‘Add to Cart’ button and the input field.
Set the value of the “onclick” attribute to the appropriate functions (add items, remove items, update displayed content).
Step 5: Test the application

Open the HTML file in a web browser and test the shopping cart functionality.
Add and remove items, update quantities, and ensure that the total cost updates accordingly.
Step 6: Debug and refine the code

Address any issues, bugs, or inconsistencies in the code.
Improve the code as needed to ensure the application works smoothly and efficiently.
